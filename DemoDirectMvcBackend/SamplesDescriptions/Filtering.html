    There are several ways of filtering the cube data in code:
    <ol>
        <li>
            Making some hierarchy members invisible;        
        </li>
        <li>
            Context filtering of hierarchy members by captions;
        </li>
        <li>
            Context filtering of Date-hierarchy members (members’ captions must have DateTime format);
        </li>
        <li>
            Context filtering of measure values.
        </li>
    </ol>

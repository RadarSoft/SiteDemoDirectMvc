// Adding the calculated hierarchy "Employee Name" into the "Employees" dimension.
// The "Employee Name" column is calculated in the TOLAPCube.OnCalculateField even handler.
cube.AddCalculatedColumn(d.Employees, "Employee Name", typeof(String));
cube.AddHierarchy("Employees", d.Employees, "Employee Name", "ReportsTo", "Employees");

// Just the same thing might be done with the follow code:
// cube.AddCalculatedHierarchy("Employees", d.Employees, typeof(string), "Employee Name");

// Adding the "Sales" measure. It is calculated in the TOLAPCube.OnCalculateField even handler.
cube.AddCalculatedMeasure(d.Order_Details, typeof(double), "Sales");

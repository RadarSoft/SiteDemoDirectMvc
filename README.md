# SiteDemoDirectMvc

This application demonstrates capabilities of the RadarCube components of Direct Edition in an ASP.NET MVC project.

The app is implemented as a SPA using ASP.NET MVC integrated with Angular 2. Therefore loading the RadarCube OLAP components AJAX requests are used.

The demonstration is built of Samples that describe functionality, contain code examples of implementation, and display the result.

Navigation through the Samples is carried out by a tree menu. Nodes of the tree can be fully expanded or collapsed to the root elements by one click. It is possible to search for Samples by their name.

A path to an active Sample is displayed in a breadcrumb. Clicking on an element of the path calls a context menu for choosing a Sample.

# SiteDemoDirectMvc

There is an application that has been created to demonstrate capabilities of the RadarCube components (Direct Edition) on [Online Demo Site](http://aspnet-mvc.demos.radar-soft.com).

It is implemented as a SPA using ASP.NET MVC integrated with Angular 2 and has a Bootstrap style. 

AJAX requests are used to load the RadarCube OLAP components.

The demonstration is built of Samples that describe functionality, contain code examples of implementation and display the result.

Navigation through the Samples is carried out by a tree menu. Nodes of the tree can be fully expanded or collapsed to the root elements by one click. It is possible to search for Samples by their name.

A path to an active Sample is displayed in a breadcrumb. Clicking on an element of the path calls a context menu for choosing a Sample.
